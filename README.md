# 🔍 Clash of the GPU and CPU Titans : Intel vs Nvidia, AMD, Arm

## 📖 Overview

This project investigates the reasons behind Intel’s decline in dominance in the CPU and GPU markets, which allowed competitors like AMD, ARM, and Nvidia to overtake it. Through financial ratio analysis and strategic business evaluation, the study highlights Intel’s challenges in adapting to technological advancements and making effective leadership decisions.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
1. Analyze financial ratios to evaluate Intel’s performance compared to its competitors.
2. Investigate Intel’s strategy and responsiveness to emerging technologies (e.g., IoT, AI, smartphones).
3. Assess leadership decisions, including the impact of CEO choices, on Intel’s competitive standing.
4. Provide actionable insights into areas of improvement for Intel.

## 🔑 Highlights

## 💡 Conclusion:
Intel's downfall was attributed by three major reasons:
1. Failure to evolve with technology i.e. they failed to adapt - Moore’s law, they were too comfortable , did not take advantage of expansion opportunities.Intel missed out on the four major industries that developed over the past 20 years i.e. smartphone industry, gaming ,cryptocurrency and AI
2. Management blunder: they hired CEOs who did not have much experience in the GPU/CPU industry ,prioritized what was not necessarily important for the organization's growth
